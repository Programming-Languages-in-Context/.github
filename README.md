# Programming Languages in Context

This organization is dedicated to the development of digital texts that each serve a dual purpose, introducing both a new programming language _and_ a topic in the Computer Sciences where the given language is often used.

The goal is to help produce computer scientists and software engineers who have a broad understanding of both the science and practice of programming.
