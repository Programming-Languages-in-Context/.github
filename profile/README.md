# Programming Languages in Context

This organization is dedicated to the development of digital texts that each serve a dual purpose, introducing both a new programming language _and_ a topic in the Computer Sciences where the given language is often used.

The goal is to help produce computer scientists and software engineers who have a broad understanding of both the science and practice of programming.

Each text title would have a name following the convention `Topic + Language`.
The inspiration for this series comes from [Chemistry: The Science in Context](https://books.google.com/books/about/Chemistry.html?id=KgOTRAAACAAJ) by Gilbert et al., which grounded each chapter's topic in a practical problem in chemistry. This series of texts attempts to expand that idea to each text as a whole, grounding a programming language in a computer science topic.
